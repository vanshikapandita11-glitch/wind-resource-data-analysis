# Wind Resource Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of wind resource data using Python. The objective is to process time-series wind data and extract meaningful insights that support wind energy assessment and reporting.

The project was developed as part of an internship-related technical work and demonstrates practical data analysis, visualization, and basic energy analytics skills.
